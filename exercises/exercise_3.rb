# 1. Load the third store (into `@store3`) as you did the other two before.
@store3 = Store.find(3)

# 2. Using Active Record's `destroy` method, delete the store from the database.
@store3.destroy

# 3. Verify that the store has been deleted by again outputting (`puts`ing) the `count` (as you did in Exercise 1.)
puts Store.count
